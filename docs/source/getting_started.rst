===============

TimeSeriesQueries is not yet a registered package. To add it to your Julia packages, simply do the following in
REPL::

    Pkg.clone("git://github.com/milktrader/TimeSeriesQueries.jl")

The TimeSeries package is a dependency as this package is specifically designed to work with Julian time arrays.
